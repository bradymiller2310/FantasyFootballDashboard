# **Fantasy Football Dashboard**

### **Project Overview**
This project is an interactive fantasy football analytics dashboard designed to give league managers deeper insights and comparisons than those offered by standard platforms like ESPN or Yahoo. Built in Tableau and powered by data from the NFLverse GitHub repository and ESPN’s Fantasy API, the dashboard features four main pages:

**League Home** – Overview of league performance and trends

**Player Comparison** – Side-by-side player stats and projections

**Team Comparison** – Visual breakdown of team strengths/weaknesses

**Player Projections** – Weekly fantasy point forecasts using machine learning

The dashboard allows users to explore advanced statistics, analyze weekly matchups, and make data-informed roster decisions. It is scalable and customizable to any ESPN league via simple backend adjustments. Inspired by existing dashboards and popular fantasy platforms, this tool aims to be a one-stop resource for both casual and competitive fantasy football players.

### **Dashboard Page Summaries**

#### **League Home**
- Serves as the starting point for users to get a broad overview of their fantasy league.
- Displays overall league standings, weekly scoring trends, points scored and allowed by each team, and positional points breakdown.
- Includes a table of rostered players, showing which team each player is on and their fantasy points per game.
- Features a free agency (waiver wire) table showing unrostered players and their performance—helpful for identifying waiver pickups.
- A position filter on the right side allows users to view players (both rostered and free agents) by position.

#### **Player Comparison**
- Allows users to compare any NFL players based on various weekly and season-long performance metrics.
- Users can select multiple players via filters, which update both the data table and a line chart showing fantasy points per week.

#### **Team Comparison**
- Enables comparison of fantasy teams across different metrics and timeframes.
- Users can select specific teams and weeks to compare performance.

- Provides visualizations like weekly team scoring, positional scoring breakdown, and team roster composition.

#### **Player Projections**
- Displays weekly fantasy point projections generated by a machine learning model (CatBoost).
- Each player is shown with their predicted point total for the week, along with boom and bust intervals indicating high and low outcomes.
- A sortable table shows projections alongside fantasy points per game and total points for the season.
- Users can filter by position or view all players at once for broader analysis.
