# **Fantasy Football Dashboard**

### **Project Overview**
This project is an interactive fantasy football analytics dashboard designed to give league managers deeper insights and comparisons than those offered by standard platforms like ESPN or Yahoo. Built in Tableau and powered by data from the NFLverse GitHub repository and ESPN’s Fantasy API, the dashboard features four main pages:

**League Home** – Overview of league performance and trends

**Player Comparison** – Side-by-side player stats and projections

**Team Comparison** – Visual breakdown of team strengths/weaknesses

**Player Projections** – Weekly fantasy point forecasts using machine learning

The dashboard allows users to explore advanced statistics, analyze weekly matchups, and make data-informed roster decisions. It is scalable and customizable to any ESPN league via simple backend adjustments. Inspired by existing dashboards and popular fantasy platforms, this tool aims to be a one-stop resource for both casual and competitive fantasy football players.

Below is a link to a sample dashboard showing what a user can expect from this product is shown here. Feel free to look around and provide either of us (Brady Miller - bjm6583@psu.edu, Sam Cerimele - sfc5748@psu.edu) with any feedback or improvements that you think could be made on the dashboard.

The **Getting Started** section at the bottom of this will instruct you on how to get started with creating a dashboard that is customizable to your own fantasy football league

### **Dashboard Page Summaries**

#### **League Home**
- Serves as the starting point for users to get a broad overview of their fantasy league.
- Displays overall league standings, weekly scoring trends, points scored and allowed by each team, and positional points breakdown.
- Includes a table of rostered players, showing which team each player is on and their fantasy points per game.
- Features a free agency (waiver wire) table showing unrostered players and their performance—helpful for identifying waiver pickups.
- A position filter on the right side allows users to view players (both rostered and free agents) by position.

#### **Player Comparison**
- Allows users to compare any NFL players based on various weekly and season-long performance metrics.
- Users can select multiple players via filters, which update both the data table and a line chart showing fantasy points per week.
- The data table includes metrics such as average fantasy points, touchdowns per game, yards per game, and yards per attempt.
- A dropdown menu lets users toggle between passing, rushing, and receiving stats for more targeted analysis.

#### **Team Comparison**
- Enables comparison of fantasy teams across different metrics and timeframes.
- Users can select specific teams and weeks to compare performance.
- Includes a unique “Schedule Swap” feature that lets users see how a team would perform if they had another team’s schedule—helpful for evaluating strength of schedule.
- Provides visualizations like weekly team scoring, positional scoring breakdown, and team roster composition.

#### **Player Projections**
- Displays weekly fantasy point projections generated by a machine learning model (CatBoost).
- Each player is shown with their predicted point total for the week, along with boom and bust intervals indicating high and low outcomes.
- A sortable table shows projections alongside fantasy points per game and total points for the season.
- Users can filter by position or view all players at once for broader analysis.

### **Repository Structure**
1) _ESPN_FF_Scraper.ipynb_
   - This file is the jupyter notebook file that is used to gather data on the fantasy football league using ESPN's API

2) _Fantasy Football Dashboard.twbx_
   - This file is the tableau dashboard template that the user will download to help create their own custom dashboard for their league.
   
4) _all_fantasy_data.xlsx_
   - This excel is the result of the jupyter notebook file, and is the excel file that will be used to fuel the Tableau dashboard. It contains various excel sheets, with data on weekly and season statistics, weekly league schedule and scoring, team rosters, schedule swap data and player point projections.

5) _ff_data (empty).xlsx_
   - This excel file is a template that the user may download and use if they would like to run and get past years data from nfl verse themselves. This file is not necessary to use those, as we have provided another excel file (ff_data.xlsx) that alreayd has all the past data that the user would be scraping if they wanted to run it themselves.
  
6) _ff_data.xlsx_
   - The ff_data.xlsx excel file is the result of the nflverse_data.R script and contains season long and weekly player statistics. This file is read into the jupyter notebook file and is combined with fantasy football league specific data to eventually output the all_fantasy_data.xlsx file.
  
7) _nflverse_data.R_
   - This R script gathers various data from the nflVerse github repository, where it aggregates data into season long statistics, outputting an excel file into your google drive, that has season and weekly statistical data. It gathers offensive, defensive, kicking, roster/depth chart and player information data from the repository.
